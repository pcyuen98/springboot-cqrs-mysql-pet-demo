# CQRS Pattern

**Date:** 02/22/2025  

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a design pattern that segregates **read** and **write** operations for a data store into separate data models. This approach allows each model to be optimized independently and can improve the performance, scalability, and security of an application.

## Context and Problem

In a traditional architecture, a single data model is often used for both read and write operations. This approach is straightforward and is suited for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

As applications grow, it can become increasingly difficult to optimize read and write operations on a single data model. Read and write operations often have different performance and scaling requirements. A traditional CRUD architecture doesn't take this asymmetry into account, which can result in several challenges:

- **Data mismatch:** The read and write representations of data often differ. Some fields that are required during updates might be unnecessary during read operations.
- **Lock contention:** Parallel operations on the same data set can cause lock contention.
- **Performance problems:** The traditional approach can negatively affect performance due to load on the data store and complex queries required to retrieve information.
- **Security challenges:** Managing security becomes difficult when entities are subject to both read and write operations, potentially exposing data in unintended contexts.
- **Overly complicated models:** Combining these responsibilities can make the model unnecessarily complex.

## Solution

The CQRS pattern separates **write operations (commands)** from **read operations (queries)**:

- **Commands** update data.  
- **Queries** retrieve data.  

This separation is useful in scenarios that require a clear distinction between commands and reads.

### Understand Commands

Commands should represent specific **business tasks** rather than low-level data updates.  

**Example:** In a hotel booking application:

- Correct: `Book hotel room`  
- Incorrect: `Set ReservationStatus to Reserved`

Commands capture the intent of the user and align with business processes. To ensure commands succeed, consider refining client-side validation, server-side logic, and asynchronous processing.

| Area of Refinement      | Recommendation |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| Client-side validation  | Validate conditions before sending commands to prevent obvious failures. For example, if no rooms are available, disable the "Book" button and show a user-friendly message. This reduces unnecessary server requests and improves user experience. |
| Server-side logic       | Enhance business logic to handle edge cases. For instance, manage race conditions where multiple users try to book the last room by adding them to a waiting list or suggesting alternatives. |
| Asynchronous processing | Process commands asynchronously via a queue instead of synchronously to improve performance and reliability. |

### Understand Queries

Queries **never alter data**. They return **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** that present required data in a convenient format, without any domain logic. This simplifies the design and implementation of the system.

## Separate Read Models and Write Models

Separating the read model from the write model simplifies system design by addressing specific concerns for **data writes** and **data reads**. This separation improves clarity, scalability, and performance, but introduces trade-offs:

- ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping frameworks) cannot automatically generate CQRS code from a database schema, so custom logic is needed to bridge the gap.

### Approaches

#### 1. Separate models in a single data store

- Both read and write models share a **single underlying database** but maintain **distinct logic** for their operations.  
- This is the foundational level of CQRS.  
- Benefits: clear separation of concerns, simplified system design.  
- Trade-offs: synchronization and consistency management between read and write models must be handled explicitly.
